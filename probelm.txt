Project Title:
General Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solver with Visualization and Order Comparison in Python

Problem Statement:
Develop a Python-based general-purpose ODE solver capable of handling user-input ordinary differential equations up to fourth order, including both homogeneous and non-homogeneous types. The solver should:

Accept any ODE from the user in symbolic form and validate its structure.

Determine if the ODE is solvable using symbolic methods by analyzing its characteristics (linearity, order, coefficient patterns).

Derive the auxiliary (characteristic) equation corresponding to the ODE.

Solve the auxiliary equation to find its roots and classify them into categories such as real, complex, distinct, or repeated.

Use the categorized roots to compute the general analytic solution involving both homogeneous and particular parts.

Provide graphical visualization of the solution behaviors across second, third, and fourth order ODEs using Matplotlib.

Allow comparison between the solutions of different orders, highlighting how the order affects the solution characteristics.

Optionally integrate machine learning techniques to predict solvability or approximate solutions where symbolic solutions are intractable.

The project bridges classical analytical methods with modern computational techniques to provide an interactive, adaptable tool for solving and understanding diverse ODEs encountered in scientific and engineering applications.
